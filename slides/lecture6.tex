    \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be finite sets, and let $f: X \times Y \to Z$.

    \pitem Two players, Alice and Bob, solve the \emph{communication problem for the function $f$}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The sets $X$, $Y$, $Z$, and the function $f$ are known to both players,
        \item Alice knows some $x \in X$,
        \item Bob knows some $y \in Y$,
        \item Alice and Bob want to compute $f(x,y)$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \pitem To solve the communication problem, Alice and Bob can exchange bit messages.

    \pitem The problem is solved if both players know $f(x,y)$.

    \pitem We are interested in the minimum number of bits that need to be sent in order to compute $f(x,y)$.

    \emph{Communication complexity} of $f$ is a minimal depth of
    a~protocol solving $f$, denoted $D(f)$. The same definition for relations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Examples}
    \begin{statement}
        For any $f: \{0,1\}^n \times\{0,1\}^n \to \bits$, $D(f) \le n + 1$.
    \end{statement}

    \pause
    Examples of functions with non-trivial upper bounds on communication complexity.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (Pointer Chasing) $D(\mathrm{PC}) \le k \log n$,
        where \[PC(x,y) = \underbrace{x(y(x(y\dotsb(x(y(x(y(x}_{\text{$k$ rounds}}(0))))))\dotsb))),\]
        $x$ and $y$ define a bipartite directed graph on $2n$ vertices with out-degree each vertex equal to $1$.
        They start with Alice's vertex $0$ and output the final vertex.


        \pitem $D(\mathrm{MED}) = O(\log^2 n)$, where $x$ and $y$ are interpreted as characteristic functions of subsets of $[n]$, and $\mathrm{MED}(x,y)$ is the median of their union.

        \pitem $D(\mathrm{CIS}_G) = O(\log^2 n)$, where $x$ is interpreted as the characteristic function of some clique in the graph $G$, and $y$ as the characteristic function of some independent set in the graph $G$. $\mathrm{CIS}(x,y) = 1$ if the clique and the independent set share a vertex.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lower Bounds}
    Consider a communication protocol for $f: X \times Y \to Z$. For each vertex $v$, we define the set $R_v \subset X \times Y$â€”the set of all pairs $(x,y) \in X \times Y$ for which the computation reaches vertex $v$.

    \pause
    \begin{statement}
        For all vertices $v$, the set $R_v$ is a combinatorial rectangle, i.e., there exist subsets $X_v \subset X$ and $Y_v \subset Y$ such that $R_v = X_v \times Y_v$.
    \end{statement}

    \pause
    \begin{corollary}
        The leaves of the communication protocol for the function $f$ define a partition of the set $X \times Y$ into monochromatic rectangles.
    \end{corollary}

    Let $C^R(f)$ denote the minimum number of \emph{monochromatic} rectangles covering $X \times Y$.

    \pause
    \begin{statement}
        $D(f) \ge \log C^R(f)$.
    \end{statement}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Rectangle Size Method}
    We define a certain semi-additive measure on subrectangles of $X \times Y$. Then the following estimate holds:
    \[
    C^R(f) \ge \frac{w(X \times Y)}{\max\limits_{\text{mono. } A \times B} w(A \times B)}.
    \]

    \pause
    \begin{block}{Fooling Set Method}
        This is a special case of the rectangle size method, where a certain set $F \subset X \times Y$ is fixed, and the measure $w$ is defined as follows:
        \[
        w(A \times B) = |(A \times B) \cap F|.
        \]
        If no monochromatic rectangle contains more than one element from $F$, then $C^R(f) \ge |F|$.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Matrix Rank Method}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider the \emph{function matrix $f$}---a matrix where
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the rows are indexed by the elements of $X$,
            \item the columns by the elements of $Y$,
            \item the entry $(x,y)$ contains $f(x,y)$.
        \end{itemize}
        \pitem Consider the function matrix as a matrix $M$ over some sufficiently large field.
        \pitem One can show that $C^R(f) \ge \rank M$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Exercises}

\begin{statement}
    $D(\mathrm{EQ}_n) = n + 1$, where $\mathrm{EQ}_n(x,y) = 1 \iff x = y$.
\end{statement}

\pause
\begin{statement}
    $D(\mathrm{GE}_n) = n + 1$, where $\mathrm{GE}_n(x,y) = 1 \iff x \ge y$.
\end{statement}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Probabilistic Protocols}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Alice receives a pair $(x,r)$ as input, where $x \in X$, and $r$ is a random string.
    \pitem Bob receives a pair $(y,s)$ where $y \in Y$, and $s$ is a random string.
    \pitem The functions $g_v$ and $h_v$ written at the vertices of the protocol for such a game will take two argumentsâ€”the input and the random string, i.e., the messages sent can depend on the random bits.

    \pitem Accordingly, the result of the game will depend on $x,y,r,s$.
    \end{itemize}

    \pause
    \begin{definition}
        A probabilistic protocol $\epsilon$-computes $f$ if for any pair $x,y$, with probability (over the choice of $(r,s)$) at least $1 - \epsilon$, the result of the protocol equals $f(x,y)$. The minimum height of a probabilistic protocol that $\epsilon$-computes $f$ is denoted by $R^\epsilon(f)$.
    \end{definition}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Examples}
    \begin{statement}
        $R^\epsilon(\mathrm{EQ}_n) = O(\log n + \log(1/\epsilon))$.
    \end{statement}

    \pause
    \begin{statement}
        $R^\epsilon(\mathrm{GE}_n) = O(\log n(\log n + \log(1/\epsilon)))$.
    \end{statement}

    \pause
    \begin{statement}
        If Alice and Bob have access to a common source of randomness (i.e., $r = s$), they can $\epsilon$-compute the predicate $\mathrm{EQ}_n$ by sending $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ bits.
    \end{statement}

    \pause
    \begin{statement}
        If Alice and Bob have access to a common source of randomness, then for any fixed positive $\epsilon$, they can $\epsilon$-compute the predicate $\mathrm{GE}_n$ with an error of at most $\epsilon$ by sending $O(\log n)$ bits.

\begin{frame}{Hardest distribution}
\begin{theorem}
    Let $\Pi$ be a communication protocol. For any distribution $\mu$:
    \(
    \log L(\Pi) \ge \IC_\mu^{ext}(\Pi).
    \)
    Furthermore, there exists a distribution $\mu^*$ for which
    \(
    \log L(\Pi) = \IC_{\mu^*}^{ext}(\Pi).
    \)
    We will call $\mu^*$ the \emph{hardest} distribution for $\Pi$.
\end{theorem}\pause
\begin{proof} For deterministic protocols, $\IC^{ext}(\Pi) = H_\mu(\Pi)$.
    The first statement of the theorem follows from the upper bound on entropy (the entropy
    of a random variable does not exceed the logarithm of the number of outcomes):
    \[
    \IC_\mu^{ext}(\Pi) = H_\mu(\Pi) \le \log L(\Pi).
    \]

    \pause
    To prove the second statement, we present the distribution $\mu^*$:
    we randomly (uniformly) select a leaf $l$ of the protocol $\Pi$ and in the corresponding rectangle $R_l$, we choose any pair $(x,y)$. The resulting distribution $\mu^*$ is uniform over the leaves of $\Pi$,
    \[
    \IC_{\mu^*}^{ext}(\Pi) = H_{\mu^*}(\Pi) = \log L(\Pi).
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{frame}{Khrapchenko's Theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Khrapchenko]
    $L(\oplus_n) \ge n^2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We will show that for any protocol there exists a distribution $\mu$: $\IC^{ext}_\mu(\Pi) \ge 2\log n$.
    \pause
    It immediately implies that $L(\oplus_n) \ge n^2$.
    The distribution $\mu$ will be the uniform distribution over pairs of the form $(x,x \oplus e_i)$,
    where $\oplus_n(x) = 0$, and the string $e_i$ has a 1 in position $i$ and 0s in all other positions.
    \pause
    \[
    \IC_\mu^{ext}(\Pi)
    \ge \IC_\mu^{int}(\Pi)
    = I(\Pi:X \mid Y) + I(\Pi:Y \mid X).
    \]
    \pause Let's consider one of the terms $I(\Pi:X \mid Y)$.
    \[\begin{aligned}
        I(\Pi:X \mid Y) &= H(X \mid Y) - H(X \mid Y,\Pi)\\
        &= H(i \mid Y) - H(i \mid Y,\Pi) = \log n - 0.
    \end{aligned}\]
    \pause Thus, $\IC_\mu^{ext}(\Pi) \ge 2\log n$.
    \end{proof}
